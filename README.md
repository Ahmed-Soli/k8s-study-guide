# 🚀 Kubernetes Lab Notes or K8S Study Guide

Welcome to **K8S Study Guide** – a hands-on, practical guide built from real-world experimentation and learning. This repository contains a growing collection of self-contained Kubernetes labs covering core concepts, configurations, and DevOps use cases.

Whether you're new to Kubernetes or deepening your admin skills, this repo is designed to help you understand **how it really works under the hood**.

## 📘 Repository Structure

Each section is organized in its own folder and includes its own `README.md` and step-by-step instructions. Here's what's available so far:

| Section | Description |
|--------|-------------|

| [`installing-kubeadm-on-centos`](./installing-kubeadm-on-centos/README.md) | Learn how to install docker runtime, kubeadm, kubectl, kubelet, initalise a cluster, setup Calico CNI. |

> More sections will be added soon, covering topics like workload management, networking, Helm, monitoring, and more.

## 📌 Why This Repo?

There’s a big gap between theory and practice. This repo aims to close that gap by documenting the *exact commands*, *file structures*, and *real output* seen in actual environments — helping you **build muscle memory** and internalize how Kubernetes works.
